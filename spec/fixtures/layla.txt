What will you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know, it's just your foolish pride

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say "We'll never find a way"
And tell me all my love's in vain

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
